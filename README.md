# Dining-Philosophers
Repo for concurrent and parallel programming assingment.

## Introduction
In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.
It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present formulation.

## Goal
The main goal of this exercise is to come up with solutions to avoid <b>DeadLock</b>

## Technologies
For this project our team will use python, adding the threading library.
